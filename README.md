## Features

### Image Processing
- Generate histograms of images.
- Split images into RGB channels.
- Apply Gaussian blur to images.

### Object Detection
- Detect objects in videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.
- Track progress of video processing tasks.

### Object Tracking
- Track objects across video frames using a custom object tracker.
